# Photon-trajectory-near-black-hole
Photon trajectory calculation and visualization in 2D using Python scripting in Blender 3D software

A python script in Blender 2.82a is used to calculate the x and y coordinates of the trajectories of photons traveling towards a black hole and create Blender Grease Pencil objects to visualize the Schwartzschiel Radius and the photon trajectories. 

Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline.

How to use
Download and install the latest Blender software here www.blender.org and dowwnload and open the blend file in this repository in Blender, that's it. 

The python script (part of the blend file) contains parameters near the top you can play around with to get different trajectories. Each time you run the script, the existing Grease Pencil objects are deleted and new ones are created based on the parameters in the script. 

Blender is a very powerful 3D creation suite so if you know Blender you can go all out with this.

I am not a professional programmer so many things in the python script could have been done more efficient i am sure.

Use this anyway you want. Hopefully it is worthwile for someone.
